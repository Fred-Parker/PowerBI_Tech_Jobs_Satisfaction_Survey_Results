# Tech Jobs Satisfaction Survey Results - (PowerBI) Dashboard & Analysis

My objective during this project was to create an **interactive and intuitive PowerBI dashboard** that highlighted key findings and insights from a Tech Job Satisfaction survey conducted across various tech job fields and careers.

<h2 id="methodology / approach">Methodology / Approach</h2>

For this project I used various PowerBI methods & syntax to query the data and build an interactive dashboard. including:
**Table view, DAX, split columns by delimiter, filters, data visualisations / formatting and editing**

**Data Cleaning:** Streamlined the dataset by removing duplicates and irrelevant columns. Used DAX to split salary brackets, calculate average salaries for tech roles, and tidy free-text responses into a consolidated “Other” category. Ensured all columns were properly formatted and standardised.

**Visualisation:** Built an engaging dashboard showcasing key statistics from the tech job satisfaction survey. Included cards, bar and stacked column charts, gauges, a tree map, and a doughnut chart.

**User-Friendly Design:** Crafted an intuitive, accessible dashboard with seamless navigation and customisation options, allowing users to easily adapt visuals and tables to changes in data.

<h2 id="key findings">Key Findings</h2>

<li>The survey had 630 participants, 50.8% of whom were female & 49.2% of whom were male.</li>
<li>Data Analysts made up the largest group, with 381 participants.</li>
<li>The average age of participants was roughly 29 / 30 years old.</li>
<li>The United States accounted for 41.4% of respondents, though participants came from across the globe.</li>
<li>Data Scientists earned the highest average salaries, followed by Data Engineers and Data Architects.</li>
<li>Python topped the list of preferred programming languages.</li>
<li>Salary satisfaction scored 4.27/10, while work-life balance rated 5.74/10.</li>

<h2 id="conclusions & insights">Conclusions & Insights</h2>

<li>The dashboard offers valuable insights for those exploring a career in data, helping individuals weigh salary, work-life balance, and career progression to make informed decisions.</li>
<li>Data Science stands out as a promising field, boasting the highest salaries, salary satisfaction, and work-life balance ratings. However, the survey sample for Data Scientists was much smaller than for Data Analysts, highlighting the need to gather more input from Data Scientists for a broader and more representative dataset.</li>
<li>Interestingly, Data Analysts, despite being the largest group, scored lower on salary satisfaction, suggesting a potential gap in expectations versus reality.</li>
<li>Additionally, Python remains the most preferred programming language, reflecting its versatility in the tech world.</li>
<li>Participants from the United States dominated the survey responses, which may introduce geographical biases. Expanding survey outreach globally could enrich the dataset with diverse perspectives.</li>
<li>This dataset comes from a real survey by Alex the Analyst (YouTube Channel) and provides valuable insights into tech job satisfaction. However, it primarily reflects Data Analysts, which isn’t surprising given Alex Freberg’s audience. Expanding the sample to include more participants from other data roles would create a more balanced dataset and help those uncertain about their career paths to explore diverse opportunities.</li>
<li>The survey highlights key trends across data professions. Python emerges as the dominant programming language, underscoring its popularity and versatility.</li>
<li>The United States accounts for a significant portion of respondents, pointing to possible geographic biases — global outreach could enrich the dataset with varied perspectives.</li> 
<li>Data Scientists, despite being underrepresented in the sample, show the highest average salaries, salary satisfaction, and work-life balance ratings, reaffirming the appeal of this career path.</li>
<li>Interestingly, salary satisfaction across data roles still scores lower than expected, suggesting a possible mismatch between expectations and reality in the tech industry. Work-life balance ratings are only slightly higher, highlighting an area that many professionals may need to navigate carefully when choosing a career.</li>
